# Bachelor Artificial Intelligence for Game Assignment 2
Path Finding

Made through shaders AGAIN! Oh yeah I nailed GLSL. After the Game of Life assignemnt this was cakewalk.
Although it's not just sunshine, I didn;t nail down the mouse to texture coordinate thing so that was a bummer.
Can you imagine where I will be if I had follow through in GLSL, I wonder too.
